# spikeinterface-gui

GUI for spikeinterface objects without copy.

This is a cross platform viewer to inspect the final results
and quality of any spike sorter supported by spikeinterface 
(kilosort, spykingcircus, tridesclous, moutainssort, yass, ironclust, herdinspikes, hdsort, klusta...)

Contrary to other viewers (like  phy), this viewer skip the tedious and long step of
copying and reformating the entire dataset (filetred signal + waveform + PCA) to a particular
format or folder organisation. This gui is built on top of spike interface objects
(Recording, Sorting, WaveformExtractor)
Theses objects are "lazy" and retrieve data on the fly (no copy!).

This viewer internally use Qt (with PySide6, PyQT6 or PyQt5) and pyqtgraph.

This viewer is local desktop app (old school!!).
There is a web based viewer work-in-progres [here](https://github.com/magland/sortingview).

## Launch

You will need this viewer only and only if you known a bit of [spikeinterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/)

### Step 1 : extract waveforms

You first need to "extract waveform" with spikeinterface
See help [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/core/plot_4_waveform_extractor.html#sphx-glr-modules-core-plot-4-waveform-extractor-py)

Note that:
  * not all waveforms snipet are extracted (See `max_spikes_per_unit`)
  * this step is cached to a folder (and can be reloaded)
  * this step can be run in parralel (and so quite fast)

  
Example:

```python
from spikeinetrface.full as si
recording = si.read_XXXX('/path/to/my/recording')
recording_filtered = si.bandpass_filter(recording)
sorting = si.run_sorter('YYYYY', recording_filtered)
waveform_forlder = '/path/for/my/waveforms'
we = si.extract_waveforms(
    recording_filtered, sorting, waveform_folder,
    max_spikes_per_unit=500,
    ms_before=3., ms_after=4.,
    n_jobs=10, total_memory='500M',
    progress_bar=True,
)
```

### Step 2 : open the GUI

With python:

```python
import spikeinterface_gui
#Â This cerate a Qt app
app = spikeinterface_gui.mkQApp() 
# reload the waveform folder
we = WaveformExtractor.load_from_folder(waveform_forlder)
# create the mainwindow and show
win = spikeinterface_gui.MainWindow(we)
win.show()
# run the main Qt6 loop
app.exec_()
```

With the commend line

```
sigui /path/for/my/waveforms
```


## Install

You need first to install one this 3 packages (by order of preference):
  * `pip install PySide6`
  * `pip install PyQt6`
  * `pip install PyQt5`


From pypi:

```bash
pip install spikeinterface-gui
```

From sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface-gui.git
cd spikeinterface-gui
pip install .
```
